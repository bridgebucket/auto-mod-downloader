# auto-mod-downloader

misleading title (cant believe it)
it really just grabs all the files (zipped or not) and puts them all into a mod folder

ex. extracts all zipped and unzipped files/folders from downloads and puts them into gamedir/mods

easiest way to use it is to download the .exe (in releases) and use that

if u want to check out the source code then the non gui version is named carmexflavorleaks.py
and the non gui ver is sexbomb.py
