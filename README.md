# auto-mod-downloader

## shitty program that lets you put mods from ur downloads folder to ur mods folder

let me tell you a story

Once upon a time,
in a land far far away
lived some retard
who wanted a faster way
to download mods manually.

"Use Nexus Mod Manager? 
Blasphemous" It would say.

"The game has a built-in
mod downloading feature? So what?
It's not like it works anyways..."
It exclaimed (while side eyeing bonelab).

And so the puppygirl worked tirelessly,
working to create one of the most in-depth
manual mod downloaders ever.

It failed.

But the product still worked.


I suppose..
